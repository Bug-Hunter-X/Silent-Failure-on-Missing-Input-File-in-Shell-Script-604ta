This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in shell scripting: silent failure when an input file is missing. The script `bug.sh` attempts to process a file but doesn't explicitly handle the case where the file doesn't exist. This leads to unexpected behaviorâ€”the script appears to run without error, but no processing occurs. The solution, `bugSolution.sh`, demonstrates the correct way to handle this situation using proper error checking and informative error messages.
